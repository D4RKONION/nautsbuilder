[{"name":"Froggy G","description":"Straight out of the marsh pond ghettos of planet Ribbit IV comes the amphibious B.I.G., also known as Nate Frogg, but mostly known as Froggy G. Growing up in the baddest part of town, struggle and incarceration surrounded Froggy from an early age. Taking part in his first swim-by shootout as a tadpole, Froggy seemed destined for a life of crime and prison.\n\nAfter a bloody gangwar with the neighbouring Toad-unit posse ended in a 5 year jail sentence, Froggy G vowed to end his gangsta ways. Instead, Froggy G started earning his keep as a beatboxing streetdancer and rapper, hoping to be picked up by a major record label. Unfortunately, his tracks titled \"Pond Pimpin\", \"Froggin' dirty\" and \"Motherfrogger bounce!\" didn't earn him much.\n\nIn order to make some money, and then make some mo', Froggy G became a hired gun. Combining his shoot-out experiences with lethal watery dance-moves and beatboxing techniques, Froggy G now spins and dashes across intergalactic battlefields, droppin foo's left and right with his fishgun, hoping to make some money to take his momma out of the hood.","icon":"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121003233921/awesomenauts/images/a/a3/Icon_Froggy.png","attacktype":"Short Range","role":"Brawler","wikiurl":"http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Froggy_G","image":"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121005031513/awesomenauts/images/thumb/f/fd/FroggyG_Alpha.png/1000px-FroggyG_Alpha.png"},{"name":"Sheriff Lonestar","description":"At the heart of the milky way lies the Bovinion system, ruled by a semi intelligent cow-like species. Although technologically advanced to an acceptable level, these Bovinions have maintained a tribal form of society for several thousands of years. Until recent years, an age-old custom in this society was to scare young Bovinian calves with boogeyman stories about a scary cowboy. Naughty Bovinion calves would, as the story went, be caught by this cowboy's unrelenting lasso.\n\nRecently, a wealthy Bovinian visionary opened up a park where visitors would come to see a genetically re-engineered cowboy in action. But disaster struck and the cowboy escaped his cage. Before the Bovinions could react the cowboy had wrangled the entire park staff. Terror shook the Bovinion civilization as the cowboy started to wrangle every single Bovinion on the planet! Suddenly the Bovinions found themselves out of their cities and wrangled into herds on green meadows by the whisky drinking, bucket spitting, yeeehaawing horror.\n\nOnce the entire Bovinian civilization had been wrangled, the cowboy, naming himself Sherriff Lonestar, rode a rocketship into the sunset, his job complete. Now Sherriff Lonestar fights as a mercenary in the robot wars, combining his awesome cowboy-powers with high tech weaponry to earn some solar to spend on whisky and cigars.","icon":"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121003233922/awesomenauts/images/f/f1/Icon_Lonestar.png","attacktype":"Medium Range","role":"Pusher","wikiurl":"http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Sheriff_Lonestar","image":"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121005031511/awesomenauts/images/thumb/b/b4/SheriffLonestar_Alpha.png/1000px-SheriffLonestar_Alpha.png"},{"name":"Leon Chameleon","description":"Leon's life is a life of crime, women, and borrowing without returning.

He's saving up money to pay for therapy, but keeps losing it due to damage compensations. Originally created as part of a robot army built to combat an immensely powerful super villain terrorizing the outer star systems, Clunk found himself without a job when the villain accidentally died of a nasty bacterial infection before the robot army was completed.\n\nThis was actually a blessing in disguise for Clunk, since he was never designed to return in one piece from his mission. He was refitted to do standard housekeeping work, but soon found himself out of work once more as he kept blowing aggression inhibitors and subsequently went into immensely destructive \ntantrums.\n\nEventually, Clunk signed up as a mercenary to do what he is best at: wrecking things.

Rumor has it he once was a researcher at a star-encapsulating power station. The station made intergalactic headlines when it exploded around 500 years ago, sending off ail kinds of strange, unseen radiation into space. In this explosion, the Al core of the Zero's was destroyed, bringing an abrupt end to the First Al War. Although peace was maintained for some centuries, the war eventually returned. Some think that war was just too profitable, and suspect that weapon manufacturers had a hand in the construction of a new Al core for the Zero's.\nThe explosion at the power station destroyed almost every part of Voltar's body, leaving only his brilliant brain intact. This brain was carefully placed inside a Braintank by salvagers. Through the years, and with help of his loyal robot drones, he made some nifty modifications to his braintank that enabled him to participate in the newly erupted Robot Wars.\n\nNo-one knows Voltar's true motives for participating in the war as a mercenary, but what can be assured is that heâ€™s a mastermind with unmatched psychotechnic powers and an arsenal of armed robots that do his every bidding.","icon":"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121003233925/awesomenauts/images/d/d5/Icon_Voltar.png","attacktype":"Short Range","role":"Healer","wikiurl":"http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Voltar_the_Omniscient","image":"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121005031510/awesomenauts/images/thumb/3/31/Voltar_Alpha.png/1000px-Voltar_Alpha.png"},{"name":"Coco Nebulon","description":"Hailing from a psyonic race near the outer brim of the galaxy, comes Coco Nebulon, the cosmic waveblazer.
