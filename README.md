# NautsBuilder

You play Awesomenauts and are tired to navigate on the wiki to try new builds? **Things have changed**. The NautsBuilder allows you to create and share builds easily, on the web.

## How it works

Mostly built with Backbone.js, the thing with this app is that it gets all its data from **a google spreadsheet** thanks to Tabletop.js.

This allows to quickly and easily change characters attributes and upgrades in case of Awesomenauts patchs.

The only "catch" is that this spreadsheet must be filled will all the characters, all their skills, and all their upgrades. This is easy (thanks copy and paste) but takes a little while as a one-man team.

Currently only one character is in the spreadsheet, mostly to test, since the app is in active work in progress.

The spreadsheet is available here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuPP-DBESPOedDl3UmM1bHpYdDNXaVRyTTVTQlZQWVE&usp=sharing - If you wanna help by filling info for some characters, let me know!

## Filling the spreadsheet correctly
